        "Description": "Looking for a lifestyle change or an investment opportunity? Then this could be worth looking at.\n            Set on an elevated 3,924m2 site on the outskirts of Victor Harbor \"Sea View Apartments\" offers a comfortable 2 story home with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and 2 living areas plus a balcony with panoramic sea views overlooking Victor Harbor plus 5 single story income producing 2 bedroom strata titled units which are well presented, clean and inviting. The 5 single story units are semi detached and offer an open plan air conditioned kitchen/meals/lounge room plus 2 bedrooms, separate bathroom and carport.\n            Located in the Fleurieu Peninsula's premier holiday destination and opposite the Victor Harbor Golf club consolidates this as a very appealing place to visit and stay.\n            All the units currently have long term tenancies but would be ideal for the weekend escape if you wanted to run the property as a live on site motel style complex. Extras include the separate communal laundry, children's playground, and access to bore water as well as mains water and a separate lock up garage.\n            With excellent potential this could be the life changing opportunity you need. Also being classed as 6 strata titled units it creates the opportunity to sell the units off individually in the future.\n\n            To find out more about this exciting opportunity please contact John Mowling on 0407 311 976.\n\n            RLA47423",
